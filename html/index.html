      'Abandoned Mansion' is a short interactive story where you'll navigate through different scenes as you try to escape this mysterious location. Each one of your choices will take you down
      a different path, with only one way out. Each page contains additional details on how to successfully escape under the 'Walkthrough tab', in case you're not able to find the correct path.
