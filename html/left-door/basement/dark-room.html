  <h2>Dark Room in the Basement</h2>
  <p>
    The basement is pitch black, you're unable to see anything. You're thinking of using your flashlight to navigate, however, you wouldn't want to alert anyone (or anything)
    that may reside inside of the mansion.

    <li>Explore with your flashlight off</li>
