  <h2>Hidden Passage</h2>
  <p>
    After entering the hidden passage, you've encountered two possible paths. Still weary of an unknown creature or spirits that may reside within the mansion, you notice
    there's a faint light emitting from one of them. Each path could be an exit, or your demise. Choose wisely
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow the light</li>
    <li>Go down the dark path</li>
  </ul>
