    <h2>The hallway</h2>
    <p>
      You find yourself in a hallway, it's incredibly dark but you're still able to make out two distinct pathways. One leads upstairs, the other one down to a basement.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Head upstairs</li>
      <li>Head down to the basement</li>
    </ul>

      <summary>Walkthrough</summary>
      You can pick either, you can escape either through the room upstairs or the basement
